# Pong Game :joystick:
It is a basic *'Pong game'* built using the C++ **` Raylib `** library.

Video games are a great way to learn programming as we get a visual feedback for everything we code. 
Pong was released in 1972 by Atari, itâ€™s simple in nature and fun to play. This is a version of the classic game which is made using the *Raylib* C++ library. 

This a Player vs PC version of the game. The code for 2 player version :video_game::video_game: has also been added to the main code file (in comments).

### Tech/Framework used :

1. Language : C++
2. IDE : CodeBlocks
3. Library : [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)

### Instructions :

In order to make changes to the code or to play the game you will need to install and setup raylib on your machine :computer:.  
You can refer to this link : [Raylib setup](https://youtu.be/a2IUxJFr8sg)

You can directly download the .exe file and play the game (make sure you setup raylib first).
