Video games are a great way to learn programming as we get a visual feedback for everything we code. 
Pong was released in 1972 by Atari, itâ€™s simple in nature and fun to play. This is a version of the classic game which is made using the **` Raylib `** C++ library. 

This a Player vs PC version of the game. The code for 2 player version has also been added to the main code file (in comments).
